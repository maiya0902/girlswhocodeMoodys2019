    5. Have an average age of 14 with the oldest orca in captivity living to only 30 years old (Kayla).
  </div>
  <div>
    6. There has only been one reliable report of orcas harming a human while, because of the stress of a non-natural environment, there have been three human deaths and numerous attacks.
  </div>
  <div>
    7. Most if not all orcas in captivity have a limp dorsal fin which is connected to an unhealthy or sick animal
  </div>
  <div>
    8. Orcas are forced to live with orcas from other families who don't speak the same language.
  </div>
  <div>
    9. Because they can't hunt in captivity and are fed unhealthy thawed dead fish, they are fed gelatin (huge amount of it) in order to keep the animal hydrated.
